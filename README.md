# OCR-for-time-dependent-measurements
Set of python scripts for numerical recognition in time dependent measurements.

This is a set of three python scripts intended for numerical recognition in time dependent measurements. They are made in a very simple and interactive way, in order to make them conformtable for people with no much experience in this topic. The scripts are wrote so that the input file is a video of the display showing the numerical data. For better results, it is recomended to avoid camera movements during the recording time.
